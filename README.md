This repository provides the templates you will use 
for your final project reports.
Project reports that are not in compliance with these templates
will not be accepted.

It is recommended you divide writing your report into two parts:
1. Write the content
1. Format the content

It is more efficient to focus on deciding **what** will be in your report
before worrying about **how it looks**.
Doing so will potentially save you hours of formatting your final report.

Before you begin to format your paper,
first write and save the content
as a separate text file.
Complete all content
and organizational editing
before formatting.

The template files themselves also offer specific guidance 
about how to use them.
Be sure to read them carefully,
or you may end up "breaking" the template—especially
if you use Microsoft Word.

For example,
do not number the text headings
since the template will do that for you.

# Options for Writing the Report

This repository gives you two options for writing your report:
1. Microsoft Word (more familiar but error-prone)
1. LaTeX (recommended; difficult to learn, but robust and official)

## Option 1: Microsoft Word 

Use the `conference-template-a4.docx` file
to write your report. 
Note that this Word document comes with ready-made styles
for your use and convenience.

## Option 2: LaTeX 

LaTeX is the most professional option 
for your project reports
and is the standard format 
for many international conferences, 
journals, 
and other areas of research.
Writing your project report in LaTeX
will help you to be ready 
to present your work
in local and international conferences.

There are two ways to write LaTeX files:
using an online editor such as Overleaf,
or using a locally-installed editor.
We recommend you use Overleaf
for your project report.

### Using Overleaf (Recommended)

Create an Overleaf account
(if you haven't already)
and create a new project
using the template avalable at this link:
[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn)

### Using a Local Editor & Compiler

Being able to locally write and compile LaTeX files into PDFs 
is a good skill to have
(especially in academic 
and research-oriented circles)
but can be time-consuming 
and technically complex.
Endeavor on this path at your own risk.

The files in the `latex` directory provides all the necessary files
for use in a local installation.

# Content Requirements

Your project report must be 40--50 pages long (or about 8,000--12,000 words) and contain the following sections:

| **    Element   **                    | **    Description   **                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
